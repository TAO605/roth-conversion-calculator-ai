## 2026-05-30 - Guard V1.3 YMYL Language Before UI Work

**Symptom:**

The V1.3 execution manual proposed high-risk tax/finance claims such as direct conversion recommendations, optimal conversion amounts, and absolute accuracy language.

**Root cause:**

Product strategy language from a planning document could be copied into user-facing SEO content, result copy, or AI output without a deterministic guard.

**Fix:**

Extended AI guardrails for recommendation, optimal-action, and absolute-accuracy phrases; added a source-content test that scans user-facing `src/app`, `src/content`, and `src/features` files.

**Guard:**

`tests/core/ymyl-language-guard.test.ts` fails if direct tax advice or absolute accuracy claims enter scanned source content; AI guardrail tests assert risky V1.3 phrases are blocked.

**Validation:**

`npm test -- --run tests/core/ai-guardrails.test.ts tests/core/ai-compliance-gateway.test.ts tests/core/ymyl-language-guard.test.ts`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` passed.

**Future trigger words:**

V1.3 execution, 100% accurate, optimal conversion amount, strongly recommend, you should convert, tax advice wording, YMYL SEO compliance.
